# Noise as target
A keras implementation of the [Unsupervised learning by predicting noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05310) paper  
  
Here's an analysis of the paper I rather enjoyed. [link](http://www.inference.vc/unsupervised-learning-by-predicting-noise-an-information-maximization-view-2/)  
  
This is an extraction and reformatting of the implementation my team and I made as part of the ["Mozgalo"](https://www.estudent.hr/category/natjecanja/mozgalo/) competition.
